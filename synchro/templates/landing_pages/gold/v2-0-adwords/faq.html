        <span class="p--header">Where is Synchro Gold made?</span>
        <p class="p--text">Synchro Gold is made in a cGMP and Organic Certified facility in Southern California.</p>
        <span class="p--header">Where do the ingredients come from?</span>
        <p class="p--text">Our organic turmeric and ginger extracts (supercritical CO2 extraction) come from organic-certified farms in Vietnam.  The organic certifications and inspections for both are done by QC&I International. Our sunflower lecithin comes from US-based farms and is Non-GMO Project Verified.</p>
        <span class="p--header">Where is Synchro based?</span>
        <p class="p--text">Synchro was founded in 2011 by biochemist and nutritionist Graham Ryan with the mission of helping others pursue a state of true health. Synchro is headquartered in and ships all orders from Berkeley, CA.</p>
        <span class="p--header">Who should use Synchro Gold?</span>
        <p class="p--text">Synchro Gold will be particularly beneficial to anyone suffering from joint or muscle pain, stiffness, and other arthritis symptoms. Because Synchro Gold is highly anti-inflammatory, it can also help with conditions of low energy, foggy brain and fatigue.</p>
        <span class="p--header">How does Synchro Gold work?</span>
        <p class="p--text">First and foremost, Synchro Gold works by inhibiting a critical enzyme in the inflammatory process in our body. This supports a healthy inflammation response in the body. Synchro Gold is remarkable because it also stimulates our body’s own antioxidant systems, improving the body’s ability to heal on its own.</p>
        <span class="p--header">How do I use Synchro Gold?</span>
        <p class="p--text">Drink at least 1oz of Synchro Gold every day, preferably with a light meal. We think Gold is best when mixed with warm non-dairy milk product and a bit of honey.</p>
        <span class="p--header">When can I expect results?</span>
        <p class="p--text">The beneficial effects of Synchro Gold are two-fold. Most people feel dramatically better from the very first time they take Synchro Gold, usually within 30 minutes of consuming. For other people, it takes a bit longer and the full benefits are not seen until Gold has had a chance to work consistently for a week or two. To experience the full effects of Synchro Gold , it is recommended to continue to consume at least one 1oz serving per day for a minimum of two weeks such that the full benefits (stimulation of the antioxidant systems, improved brain health) are to allowed time to sufficiently develop.</p>
        <span class="p--header">Do I need to refrigerate Synchro Gold?</span>
        <p class="p--text">Nope, Synchro Gold is very shelf stable. That being said, refrigeration after opening will preserve potency and is recommended.</p>
