              <h4 class="gold-benefits__header p--title">How does Synchro Gold work?</h4>
              <p class="p--text">First and foremost, Synchro Gold works by inhibiting a critical enzyme in the inflammatory process in our body. This produces the most dramatic reduction in pain and inflammation. Synchro Gold is remarkable because it also stimulates our body’s own antioxidant systems, improving the body’s ability to heal on its own.</p>

              <h4 class="gold-benefits__header p--title">How do I use Synchro Gold?</h4>
              <p class="p--text">Drink at least 1oz of Synchro Gold every day, preferably with a light meal. If your pain or inflammation is severe on a particular day, a second 1oz serving can help provide additional relief. We think Gold is best when mixed with warm non-dairy milk product and a bit of honey.</p>

              <h4 class="gold-benefits__header p--title">When can I expect results?</h4>
              <p class="p--text">The beneficial effects of Synchro Gold are two-fold. Most people experience a reduction in pain symptoms from the very first time they take Synchro Gold, usually within 30 minutes of consuming.  For other people, it takes a bit longer and the full benefits are not seen until Gold has had a chance to work consistently for a week or two. To experience the full effects of Synchro Gold , it is recommended to continue to consume at least one 1oz serving per day for a minimum of two weeks such that the full benefits (stimulation of the antioxidant systems, improved brain health) are to allowed time to sufficiently develop.</p>
