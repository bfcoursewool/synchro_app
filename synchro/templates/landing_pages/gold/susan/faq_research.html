            <p class="p--text">Turmeric has been shown to be more effective than ibuprofen and acetaminophen in lowering C-reactive protein levels, one of the primary markers of chronic inflammation. Turmeric works through inhibition COX-2 enzyme, a critical component of the NF-Kappa-B inflammatory signalling cascade. Turmeric is free of the toxicity and dependency issues that make continued use of OTC anti-inflammatory drugs inadvisable.†</p>

            <p class="p--text">Animal studies have shown that curcumin and tetrahydrocurcumin, two of the primary active compounds in turmeric, protect the brain against chemically-induced neurotoxicity. Ar-turmerone, another primary compound in turmeric, has been shown to stimulate neural stem cell growth and differentiation. Researchers believe this could have huge consequences for protection against neurodegenerative disease.†</p>

The progressive demethylation of DNA (largely due to toxin exposure) is one of the primary drivers of the aging process and eventually leads to cellular and metabolic dysfunction. Turmeric extract has been shown to protect against this toxin-induced demethylation of DNA.†</p>

              <h4 class="gold-benefits__header p--title">How does Synchro Gold work?</h4>
              <p class="p--text">First and foremost, Synchro Gold works by inhibiting a critical enzyme in the inflammatory process in our body. This produces the most dramatic reduction in pain and inflammation. Synchro Gold is remarkable because it also stimulates our body’s own antioxidant systems, improving the body’s ability to heal on its own.</p>

              <p class="p--text">Drink at least 1oz of Synchro Gold every day, preferably with a light meal. If your pain or inflammation is severe on a particular day, a second 1oz serving can help provide additional relief. We think Gold is best when mixed with warm non-dairy milk product and a bit of honey.</p>

              <h4 class="gold-benefits__header p--title">When can I expect results?</h4>
              <p class="p--text">The beneficial effects of Synchro Gold are two-fold. Most people experience a reduction in pain symptoms from the very first time they take Synchro Gold, usually within 30 minutes of consuming.  For other people, it takes a bit longer and the full benefits are not seen until Gold has had a chance to work consistently for a week or two. To experience the full effects of Synchro Gold , it is recommended to continue to consume at least one 1oz serving per day for a minimum of two weeks such that the full benefits (stimulation of the antioxidant systems, improved brain health) are to allowed time to sufficiently develop.</p>
