            <p class="p--text">Inflammation has just as big of an impact on the brain as it does on the body. As studies have repeatedly shown, an inflamed brain is a slow and foggy brain.

Turmeric is so strongly neuroprotective that it’s been shown to be a highly effective treatment for inflammation-driven neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s and depression.†</p>
