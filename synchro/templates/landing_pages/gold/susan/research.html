            <p class="p--text">Turmeric has been shown to be more effective than ibuprofen and acetaminophen in lowering C-reactive protein levels, one of the primary markers of chronic inflammation. Turmeric works through inhibition COX-2 enzyme, a critical component of the NF-Kappa-B inflammatory signalling cascade. Turmeric is free of the toxicity and dependency issues that make continued use of OTC anti-inflammatory drugs inadvisable.†</p>

            <p class="p--text">Animal studies have shown that curcumin and tetrahydrocurcumin, two of the primary active compounds in turmeric, protect the brain against chemically-induced neurotoxicity. Ar-turmerone, another primary compound in turmeric, has been shown to stimulate neural stem cell growth and differentiation. Researchers believe this could have huge consequences for protection against neurodegenerative disease.†</p>

              <p class="p--text">Under ideal circumstances, our DNA is bound to and protected by a series of methyl groups in a process called DNA methylation. The progressive demethylation of DNA (largely due to toxin exposure) is one of the primary drivers of the aging process and eventually leads to cellular and metabolic dysfunction. Turmeric extract has been shown to protect against this toxin-induced demethylation of DNA.†</p>
