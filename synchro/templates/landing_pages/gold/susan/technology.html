          <p>Our proprietary CO2 extraction of turmeric root delivers levels of turmeric alkaloids that are head and shoulders above other extracts. Unlike other turmeric golds, which deliver only one or a few of the root’s active alkaloids, our CO2 extraction boasts the full spectrum of turmeric alkaloids, just as you would find in raw turmeric root. As studies have shown, full-spectrum extracts of turmeric produce a number of health benefits that are lost with other extraction technologies, most notably the stimulation of the body’s antioxidant systems.</p>
