                <p>Synchro Gold pairs innovative turmeric extraction technologies with black pepper extracts and liposomal delivery to deliver ALL of turmeric's profoundly healing active compounds to your body in their most bioavailable form.</p>
                <p>This powerful combination helps to fight inflammation, increase mental clarity, and improve overall energy levels, so that you can experience True Health.</p>

                <p>While other turmeric extracts deliver only one or a few of the root’s active alkaloids (curcumin, for example), Our proprietary CO2 extraction contains the full spectrum of turmeric alkaloids, just as you would find in raw turmeric root. Full-spectrum extracts of turmeric have been shown to stimulate production of powerful antioxidant enzymes in the body, “turning on” our body’s innate healing response.</p>

                <h5 class="tab-content--header">Liposomal Delivery</h5>
                <p>In their raw form, turmeric’s potent alkaloids are poorly absorbed by the digestive tract. To address this, we pioneered the first truly liposomal turmeric product. By binding the turmeric alkaloids to a specific type of fat called phospholipids, Synchro Gold dramatically improves absorption into the body. Studies have shown that liposomal delivery makes turmeric’s healing alkaloids up to six times more bioavailable.</p>

                <p>Under normal circumstances, a large portion of the turmeric alkaloids are broken down in the gut before they can be absorbed. Extracted from organic black pepper fruit, piperine inhibits an enzyme in our gut, drastically reducing this premature break down. Studies have shown up to a twenty-fold increase in bioavailability when turmeric is paired with black pepper fruit extract.</p>
