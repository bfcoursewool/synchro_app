      <div class="faq__copy">
        <p class="p--text">First and foremost, Synchro Gold works by inhibiting a critical enzyme in the inflammatory process in our body. This supports a healthy inflammation response in the body. Synchro Gold is remarkable because it also stimulates our body’s own antioxidant systems, improving the body’s ability to heal on its own.</p>

      <span class="p--header">When can I expect results?</span>
      <div class="faq__copy">
        <p class="p--text">The beneficial effects of Synchro Gold are two-fold. Most people feel dramatically better from the very first time they take Synchro Gold, usually within 30 minutes of consuming. For other people, it takes a bit longer and the full benefits are not seen until Gold has had a chance to work consistently for a week or two. To experience the full effects of Synchro Gold , it is recommended to continue to consume at least one 1oz serving per day for a minimum of two weeks such that the full benefits (stimulation of the antioxidant systems, improved brain health) are to allowed time to sufficiently develop.</p>
