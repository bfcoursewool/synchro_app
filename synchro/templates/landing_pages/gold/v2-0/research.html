      <h4 class="p--title">Reduces Post-Workout Soreness</h4>
      <p class="p--text">In a study we conducted in 2015 we found that athletes who consumed 1oz of Synchro Gold 1hr following an intense workout reported significantly less soreness the following day than athletes who performed the same workout, but did not consume Synchro
        Gold. The athletes using Synchro Gold also reported greater improvements in their training metrics, suggesting the overall wellness-promoting effect of Gold may improve athletic performance over time.†</p>

      <h4 class="p--title">Powerfully Neuroprotective</h4>
      <p class="p--text">Animal studies have shown that curcumin and tetrahydrocurcumin, two of the primary active compounds in turmeric, protect the brain against chemically-induced neurotoxicity. Ar-turmerone, another primary compound in turmeric, has been shown to stimulate
        neural stem cell growth and differentiation. Researchers believe this could have huge consequences for protection against neurodegenerative disease.†</p>

      <h4 class="p--title">Effective in Treating Clinical Depression</h4>
      <p class="p--text">A 2013 study compared the efficacy of turmeric extract against SSRI's in treating major depressive disorder. A similar percentage of patients (62.5% and 64.7%, respectively) saw improvement in their degree of depression as measured by a standardized
        depression-rating test. Researchers concluded that turmeric “may be used as an effective and safe modality for treatment in patients with MDD without concurrent suicidal ideation or other psychotic disorders.”†</p>

      <h4 class="p--title">Protects Against Demethylation of DNA</h4>
      <p class="p--text">Under ideal circumstances, our DNA is bound to and protected by a series of methyl groups in a process called DNA methylation. The progressive demethylation of DNA (largely due to toxin exposure) is one of the primary drivers of the aging process
        and eventually leads to cellular and metabolic dysfunction. Turmeric extract has been shown to protect against this toxin-induced demethylation of DNA.†</p>
