        <span class="p--title faq-animate-2">Where is Synchro Gold made?</span>
        <p class="p--text faq-animate-3">Synchro Gold is made in a cGMP and Organic Certified facility in Southern California.</p>
        <span class="p--title faq-animate-4">Where do the ingredients come from?</span> 
        <p class="p--text faq-animate-5">Our organic turmeric and ginger extracts (supercritical CO2 extraction) come from organic-certified farms in Vietnam.  The organic certifications and inspections for both are done by QC&I International. Our sunflower lecithin comes from US-based farms and is Non-GMO Project Verified.</p>
        <span class="p--title faq-animate-6">Where is Synchro based?</span>
        <p class="p--text faq-animate-7">Synchro was founded in 2011 by biochemist and nutritionist Graham Ryan with the mission of helping others pursue a state of true health. Synchro is headquartered in and ships all orders from Berkeley, CA.</p>
        <span class="p--title faq-animate-8">Who should use Synchro Gold?</span>
        <p class="p--text faq-animate-9">Synchro Gold will be particularly beneficial to anyone suffering from joint or muscle pain, stiffness, and other arthritis symptoms. Because Synchro Gold is highly anti-inflammatory, it can also help with conditions of low energy, foggy brain and fatigue.</p>
        <span class="p--title faq-animate-10">How does Synchro Gold work?</span>
        <p class="p--text faq-animate-11">First and foremost, Synchro Gold works by inhibiting a critical enzyme in the inflammatory process in our body. This produces the most dramatic reduction in pain and inflammation. Synchro Gold is remarkable because it also stimulates our body’s own antioxidant systems, improving the body’s ability to heal on its own.</p>
        <span class="p--title faq-animate-12">How do I use Synchro Gold?</span>
        <p class="p--text faq-animate-13">Drink at least 1oz of Synchro Gold every day, preferably with a light meal. If your pain or inflammation is severe on a particular day, a second 1oz serving can help provide additional relief. We think Gold is best when mixed with warm non-dairy milk product and a bit of honey.</p>
        <span class="p--title faq-animate-14">When can I expect results?</span>
        <p class="p--text faq-animate-15">The beneficial effects of Synchro Gold are two-fold. Most people experience a reduction in pain symptoms from the very first time they take Synchro Gold, usually within 30 minutes of consuming.  For other people, it takes a bit longer and the full benefits are not seen until Gold has had a chance to work consistently for a week or two. To experience the full effects of Synchro Gold , it is recommended to continue to consume at least one 1oz serving per day for a minimum of two weeks such that the full benefits (stimulation of the antioxidant systems, improved brain health) are to allowed time to sufficiently develop.</p>
        <span class="p--title faq-animate-16">Do I need to refrigerate Synchro Gold?</span>
        <p class="p--text faq-animate-17">Nope, Synchro Gold is very shelf stable. That being said, refrigeration after opening will preserve potency and is recommended.</p>
