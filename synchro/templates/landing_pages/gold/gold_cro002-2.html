          <h4 class="gold-benefits__header p--title">Inflammation Fighting</h4>
          <p class="p--text">It’s been said countless times that “Inflammation is the root of all disease”. It's clear that inflammation is the primary driver behind a long list of negative health conditions, certainly including joint pain and chronic low energy.  Put simply, an inflamed body feels like crap and simply doesn’t perform as well. Synchro Gold powerfully fights inflammation by using cutting-edge nutrient delivery technologies to dramatically increase the bioavailability of the turmeric alkaloids and amplify their effects in the body.†</p>

          <h4 class="gold-benefits__header p--title">Naturally Energizing</h4>
          <p class="p--text">A vibrant and energized body is the result of a number of factors, but two stand out as the primary determinants of our energy levels: the level of inflammation in the body and brain, and our metabolic rate. On top of being a powerful inflammation-reducer, turmeric has also been shown to increase metabolic rate and promote fat metabolism. So when you feel light and energized after drinking a serving of Synchro Gold, now you’ll know why.†</p>

          <h4 class="gold-benefits__header p--title">Boosts Body's Antioxidant Systems</h4>
          <p class="p--text">Antioxidant enzymes are the body's primary system for keeping inflammation in check. Turmeric has been shown to stimulate production of our body’s three primary “super antioxidant” enzymes: superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione-s-transferase.  This means that in addition to the near-term benefits, Synchro Gold is also working over time to move the body back into a state of <span class="p--italic">true health.</span>†</p>

          <h4 class="gold-benefits__header p--title">Improves Brain Function</h4>
          <p class="p--text">Inflammation has just as big of an impact on the brain as it does on the body. As studies have repeatedly shown, an inflamed brain is a slow and foggy brain. Turmeric has also been shown to reduce inflammation in the brain, explaining its brain-enhancing properties. Turmeric is so strongly neuroprotective that it’s been shown to be a highly effective treatment for inflammation-driven neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s and depression.†</p>

          <p class="p--text">Our proprietary CO2 extraction of turmeric root delivers levels of turmeric alkaloids that are head and shoulders above other extracts. Unlike other turmeric golds, which deliver only one or a few of the root’s active alkaloids, our CO2 extraction boasts the full spectrum of turmeric alkaloids, just as you would find in raw turmeric root. As studies have shown, full-spectrum extracts of turmeric produce a number of health benefits that are lost with other extraction technologies, most notably the stimulation of the body’s antioxidant systems.</p>

          <h3 class="p--title">Liposomal Delivery</h3>
          <p class="p--text">Turmeric is an incredibly powerful plant, but it does have a critical shortcoming: turmeric alkaloids are usually poorly absorbed by the digestive tract. We’ve overcome this short- coming by creating the world’s first true liposomal turmeric gold. Our liposomal formula utilizes a specific type of fat (called phospholipids) blended under highly specific conditions. This process effectively binds the turmeric alkaloids to the phospholipids, allowing for greatly improved absorption. Studies have shown up to a 6-fold increase in bioavailability when turmeric alkaloids are delivered via liposomes.</p>

          <p class="p--text">Extracted from organic black pepper fruit, piperine is an organic compound that dramatically increases absorption of turmeric alkaloids in the gut. Piperine works by inhibiting an enzyme in our digestive tract that would otherwise break down a large portion of the turmeric alkaloids before they can be absorbed. Studies have shown up to a 2000% increase in bioavailability when turmeric is paired with black pepper fruit extract.</p>

        <h3 class="p--title">Anti-inflammatory Drugs</h3>
        <p class="p--text">Turmeric has been shown to be more effective than ibuprofen and acetaminophen in lowering C-reactive protein levels, one of the primary markers of chronic inflammation. Turmeric works through inhibition COX-2 enzyme, a critical component of the NF-Kappa-B inflammatory signalling cascade. Turmeric is free of the toxicity and dependency issues that make continued use of OTC anti-inflammatory drugs inadvisable.†</p>

Ar-turmerone, another primary compound in turmeric, has been shown to stimulate neural stem cell growth and differentiation. Researchers believe this could have huge consequences for protection against neurodegenerative disease.†</p>

A similar percentage of patients (62.5% and 64.7%, respectively) saw improvement in their degree of depression as measured by a standardized depression-rating test. Researchers concluded that turmeric “may be used as an effective and safe modality for treatment in patients with MDD without concurrent suicidal ideation or other psychotic disorders.”†</p>

      <div class="gold-faq__text wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1.5s">
        <p class="p--text"><span class="p--bold">Where is Synchro Gold made?</span> Synchro Gold is made in a cGMP and Organic Certified facility in Southern California.</p>
        <p class="p--text"><span class="p--bold">Where do the ingredients come from?</span> Our organic turmeric and ginger extracts (supercritical CO2 extraction) come from organic-certified farms in Vietnam.  The organic certifications and inspections for both are done by QC&I International. Our sunflower lecithin comes from US-based farms and is Non-GMO Project Verified.</p>
        <p class="p--text"><span class="p--bold">Where is Synchro based?</span> Synchro was founded in 2011 by biochemist and nutritionist Graham Ryan with the mission of helping others pursue a state of true health. Synchro is headquartered in and ships all orders from Berkeley, CA.</p>
        <p class="p--text"><span class="p--bold">Who should use Synchro Gold?</span> Synchro Gold will be particularly beneficial to anyone suffering from joint or muscle pain, stiffness, and other arthritis symptoms. Because Synchro Gold is highly anti-inflammatory, it can also help with conditions of low energy, foggy brain and fatigue.</p>
        <p class="p--text"><span class="p--bold">How does Synchro Gold work?</span> First and foremost, Synchro Gold works by inhibiting a critical enzyme in the inflammatory process in our body. This produces the most dramatic reduction in pain and inflammation. Synchro Gold is remarkable because it also stimulates our body’s own antioxidant systems, improving the body’s ability to heal on its own.</p>
        <p class="p--text"><span class="p--bold">How do I use Synchro Gold?</span> Drink at least 1oz of Synchro Gold every day, preferably with a light meal. If your pain or inflammation is severe on a particular day, a second 1oz serving can help provide additional relief. We think Gold is best when mixed with warm non-dairy milk product and a bit of honey.</p>
        <p class="p--text"><span class="p--bold">When can I expect results?</span> The beneficial effects of Synchro Gold are two-fold. Most people experience a reduction in pain symptoms from the very first time they take Synchro Gold, usually within 30 minutes of consuming.  For other people, it takes a bit longer and the full benefits are not seen until Gold has had a chance to work consistently for a week or two. To experience the full effects of Synchro Gold , it is recommended to continue to consume at least one 1oz serving per day for a minimum of two weeks such that the full benefits (stimulation of the antioxidant systems, improved brain health) are to allowed time to sufficiently develop.</p>
        <p class="p--text"><span class="p--bold">Do I need to refrigerate Synchro Gold?</span> Nope, Synchro Gold is very shelf stable. That being said, refrigeration after opening will preserve potency and is recommended.</p>
