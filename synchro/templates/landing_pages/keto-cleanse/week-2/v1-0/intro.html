    <span class="p--demi">Welcome to week two of the Keto Cleanse Program.</span>
    <br><br>
    This week youâ€™ll be eating a full ketogenic diet for the first time, and beginning to incorporate longer modified fasting periods.
    <br><br>
    This week is where the cleanse really starts, so hydration and electrolytes take on particular importance this week. This will ensure toxins are flushed efficiently and your energy levels stay high.
