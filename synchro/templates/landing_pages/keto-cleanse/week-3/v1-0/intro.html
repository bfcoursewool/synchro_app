    <span class="p--demi">You made it to week three of the Keto Cleanse Program! </span>
    <br><br>
    Your body should be on its way to being keto-adapted now, and you might be feeling an increase in mental sharpness and a stability in your energy levels.
    <br><br>
    This week, weâ€™ll aim to maximize autophagy by extending your modified fasting periods.
    <br><br>
    Cleansing is just as active this week as it was last, so hydration and electrolytes remain important this week to ensure toxins are flushed efficiently and your energy levels stay high.
