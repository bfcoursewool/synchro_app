        <p class="p--text">Sleep is perhaps the most overlooked “lever” we have to pull to improve the way our body functions and how we feel.</p>
        <p class="p--text">In these three weeks, sleep will be extra important to ensuring your body is cleansing toxins and adapting to ketosis efficiently, and perhaps more importantly, keeping your stress levels in check so you maintain the focus to stick with the program and don’t retreat to stress eating.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Here are some things I consider to be essential to good quality sleep:</p>
        <ol class="kcp-timeline__list p--text">
          <li><span class="p--demi">Turn off all screens for at least 1 hour before bed time.</span> The light emitted by TVs, phones, etc has been shown to disrupt melatonin, the hormone most responsible for initiating sleep.</li>
          <li><span class="p--demi">Get to bed the same time each day.</span> Research has shown this to have a huge impact on the amount of time you spend in deep sleep (and thus, how rested you feel).</li>
          <li><span class="p--demi">Make your bedroom as dark as possible.</span> Block windows and remove and light sources from the bedroom (including LEDs). If this is not possible, wear an eye mask.</li>
          <li><span class="p--demi">Turn your phone on airplane mode and unplug cordless phones and wifi routers before bed.</span> The electromagnetic field emitted by these devices is known to negatively impact sleep quality.</li>

        <p class="kcp-timeline__event"><span class="kcp-timeline__time">8-9am</span>Drink 1-1.5 liters of water with 60-90 drops of electrolyte solution</p>
      </div>
      <div class="kcp-timeline__text">
        <p class="p--text">The quality of the water you put in your body is SO important to the health and functioning of our cells.  Whenever possible, try to drink either spring water (home delivery is a good economical option), or water filtered by reverse osmosis (RO) or a ceramic filter (like Berkey filters).</p>
        <p class="p--text">This week, as you transition to ketosis, it’s particularly important to drink plenty of electrolytes. Try to get 120-150 total drops of the Elete electrolyte solution in your water throughout the day. Getting 60-90 out of the way first thing in the morning makes this much easier.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Why is this important?</p>
        <p class="p--text">As you cut carbs from your diet, your insulin levels naturally stabilize, which has the downstream effect of signaling to your kidneys to retain less water. As your kidneys purge water weight, minerals and electrolytes inevitably get purged with it.</p>
        <p class="p--text">As long as you’re drinking plenty of water in a day plus the included electrolyte solution, your hydration will be optimal. In this case, “plenty” means 2-3+ liters/day, depending on your body size and environment (i.e. bigger people in warmer/drier climates should be closer to 3+ liters/day).</p>

        <p class="kcp-timeline__event"><span class="kcp-timeline__time">9am</span>Breakfast! One packet of Ketomanna + a cup of coffee or tea (no sugar!)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="kcp-timeline__text">
        <p class="p--text">Just as with last week, a single packet of Ketomanna at breakfast is the one thing you’ll eat in your modified fasting period.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Ketomanna is rich enough that psychologically you feel at though you’ve eaten (psychology is a BIG part of the difficulty, or lack thereof, of fasting). With 12g MCT and minimal carbohydrate and protein, Ketomanna will give your body and brain an easy fuel source, but without significantly disrupting the beneficial processes of the fast as a more substantial meal would.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Caffeine is a tremendously valuable tool to use to support your cleanse process. For starters, caffeine (coffee in particular) is a good appetite suppressant, which will make your modified fasting periods easier.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Caffeine has been shown to actually increase the rate of autophagy (cellular self-cleaning), the primary cleansing process we’re trying to “turn on” with these modified fasting periods.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Be mindful of what you add to your coffee or tea, as using a creamer with significant sugar or protein will disrupt your cleanse. This means whole milk and heavy cream are out, as is any non-dairy milk not explicitly labeled as unsweetened. Go for unsweetened almond milk…or just drink it black, of course.</p>

        <p class="kcp-timeline__event"><span class="kcp-timeline__time">9:30-10:30am</span>PPrepare one serving of Ketobasis. Drink slowly over the course of an hour or so</p>
      </div>
      <div class="kcp-timeline__text">
        <p class="p--text">Ketobasis is comprised almost entirely of caprylic acid (aka C8), a specific fat from coconuts that your body converts to energy very quickly after consuming. (so quickly, in fact, that it cannot be stored as fat)</p>
        <p class="p--text">Because it converts to energy so quickly, Ketobasis will keep your energy high and brain sharp, but without disrupting the beneficial processes that you’re turning on via fasting, most notably autophagy.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Ketobasis has a slight appetite-suppressing effect which, particularly when paired with caffeine, will help keep your appetite in check throughout the fasting period.</p>
        <p class="p--text">To prepare Ketobasis, mix one serving in ~8oz of water in a jar and shake well. Drinking this slowly over the course of an hour will help to make sure your stomach is cool with it, as MCTs can create some stomach weirdness for some people if consumed too quickly.</p>

        <p class="p--text">Priorities for this meal are getting plenty of healthy fats, and keeping total carbs under 15g. You’ll learn this is more challenging than it sounds!  Carbs are hidden everywhere, in dressings and sauces and in dishes that seem to be carb-free at first glance.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="kcp-timeline__text">
        <p class="p--text">The bacteria that inhabit your GI tract (aka your “microbiome”) do so much more for you than digest your food. A healthy microbiome effectively acts as a first line of defense for your immune system, preventing harmful bacteria and viruses from entering the body. A healthy microbiome also “trains” your own immune cells to better detect and eliminate harmful bacteria  that do make it into the body.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Of course, your GI bacteria do also digest your food, which is where they have particular importance for the cleanse.  Building a robust, healthy microbiome will help to clear stagnant, undigested, and sometimes toxic material from your digestive tract.  A healthy microbiome will also adapt more quickly to digesting a higher fat intake, which is of particular importance this week.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Micro · Bios and Pre · Bios are an elegant and powerful system for building a healthy microbiome, reflecting the latest developments in microbiology research.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Micro · Bios is a spore-form PRObiotic, beneficial strains of bacteria grown in specific conditions such that they survive the acidity of the stomach and reach the small intestine where they stimulate the growth of existing beneficial bacteria already in your gut. (with non-spore-form probiotics, 99+% die in your stomach and never reach the small intestine)</p>
        <p class="p--text">Pre · Bios provides six unique types of PREbiotic fibers that provide food for the beneficial bacteria species in your gut, helping them to outcompete non-beneficial and parasitic species.</p>
        <p class="p--text">If you historically have a sensitive stomach, you could start with one serving of Pre•Bios and one capsule of Micro · Bios in the first day or two just to be sure your stomach agrees with them.</p>
