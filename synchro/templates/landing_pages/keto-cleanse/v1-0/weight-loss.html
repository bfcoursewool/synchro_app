  <h2 class="weight-loss__header">Losing Weight on the Keto Cleanse Program</h2>
  <p class="p--text weight-loss__text">So here’s the truth about weight loss:<br>The only way to actually lose body fat is to consume fewer calories than your body uses. That’s it. Anyone who tells you otherwise, or promises you a shortcut is lying to you, plain and simple. (liposuction being the one exception, I suppose)<br><br>Clearly, many, many people have huge success losing weight on a ketogenic diet. This is not because keto is a magic shortcut to weight loss, but largely because it brings your blood sugar, hormones and hunger into balance, making it infinitely easier to eat fewer calories.<br><br>The ketogenic diet also trains your body to burn fat much more efficiently, which means that body fat will come off quicker if you do choose to eat fewer calories than your body uses in a day.<br><br>So, if you choose to make weight loss a priority while on the Keto Cleanse Program, you’ll be set up well for success. Your weekly Meal Plans will give you specific suggestions to make sure you hit your goals here.
