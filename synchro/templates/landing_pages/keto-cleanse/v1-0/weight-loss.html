  <h2 class="weight-loss__header">Losing Weight on the Keto Cleanse Program</h2>
  <p class="p--text weight-loss__text">So here's the truth: The laws of thermodynamics don't offer shortcuts.
  <br><br>
  Sadly, keto is no exception. That being said, if your goal is to lose weight, keto does give you a significant head start. Ketosis brings your blood sugar, hormones and hunger into balance, making it infinitely easier to eat fewer calories than your body uses in a day. (which, as the laws of thermodynamics dictate, is the only way to lose weight)

  The ketogenic diet (particularly in combination with Modified Intermittent Fasting) also trains your body to burn fat more efficiently, which means that body fat will come off quicker when you do eat fewer calories than your body uses in a day.</p>
