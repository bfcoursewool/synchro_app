      <p class="p--text how-it-works__text">First, Micro•Bios and Pre•Bios, our medical-grade probiotics and prebiotics, help you to build a thriving microbiome and clean toxins from<span> your GI tract, transforming the quality of your digestion.</span></p>

      <h4 class="p--text how-it-works__benefit">Balances blood sugar + hormones</h4>
      <p class="p--text how-it-works__text">Daily servings of Ketomanna (our wildly-popular ketogenic chocolate fudge), Ketobasis (MCT oil powder) and Elete (trace minerals<span> + electrolytes) - plus our Keto Cleanse Meal Plans - make your
          transition to ketosis as smooth as humanly possible. Over the course of three weeks, this will have a profound positive impact on your blood sugar and hormone levels.</span></p>

      <h4 class="p--text how-it-works__benefit">Turns on fat-burning and cellular self-cleaning (aka autophagy)</h4>
      <p class="p--text how-it-works__text">Finally, using a technique called Modified Intermittent Fasting (MIF), you’ll multiply the benefits of ketosis<span> several times over. Don’t be intimidated by this part! We’ll start slow, and Modified
          Intermittent Fasting is a world easier than traditional Intermittent Fasting (IF).<br><br>In Modified IF, you’re allowed to eat Ketomanna and Ketobasis in your fasting period (yay!). With Modified IF, you get essentially all of the
          benefits of traditional IF, but without the struggle that can come with traditional IF for some people.<br><br>Ketosis plus MIF sends a strong signal to your body to “turn on” fat oxidation in adipose tissue (aka “fat burning”) and
          cellular self-cleaning (autophagy). This is where the magic happens.</span></p>

      <h4 class="p--text how-it-works__benefit">Removes toxins that slow down metabolism</h4>
      <p class="p--text how-it-works__text">As autophagy and other cleansing processes remove pro-inflammatory toxins from your body, you’ll start to see your metabolic rate - and, by<span> association, your energy levels - rise.  This means not only will you feel more energized and alive, but you’ll be burning fat at a faster rate as well.</span></p>
