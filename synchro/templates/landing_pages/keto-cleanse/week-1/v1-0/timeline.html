        <p class="p--text">Sleep is perhaps the most overlooked “lever” we have to pull to improve the way our body functions and how we feel.</p>
        <p class="p--text">In these three weeks, sleep will be extra important to ensuring your body is cleansing toxins and adapting to ketosis efficiently, and perhaps more importantly, keeping your stress levels in check so you maintain the focus to stick with the program and don’t retreat to stress eating.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Here are some things I consider to be essential to good quality sleep:</p>
        <ol class="kcp-timeline__list p--text">
          <li><span class="p--demi">Turn off all screens for at least 1 hour before bed time.</span> The light emitted by TVs, phones, etc has been shown to disrupt melatonin, the hormone most responsible for initiating sleep.</li>
          <li><span class="p--demi">Get to bed the same time each day.</span> Research has shown this to have a huge impact on the amount of time you spend in deep sleep (and thus, how rested you feel).</li>
          <li><span class="p--demi">Make your bedroom as dark as possible.</span> Block windows and remove and light sources from the bedroom (including LEDs). If this is not possible, wear an eye mask.</li>
          <li><span class="p--demi">Turn your phone on airplane mode and unplug cordless phones and wifi routers before bed.</span> The electromagnetic field emitted by these devices is known to negatively impact sleep quality.</li>

        <p class="kcp-timeline__event"><span class="kcp-timeline__time">8-9am</span>Drink 1-1.5 liters of water</p>
      </div>
      <div class="kcp-timeline__text">
        <p class="p--text">The quality of the water you put in your body is SO important to the health and functioning of our cells. Whenever possible, try to drink either spring water (home delivery is a good economical option), or water filtered by reverse osmosis (RO) or a ceramic filter (like Berkey filters). In the case of the latter two options, be sure to add a trace mineral solution like the one included in your Cleanse kit, as filtered water will lack the minerals necessary
          for proper absorption.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Drinking 1-1.5 liters of water first thing in the morning will help to replace the water you lost during sleep via perspiration and respiration (this can be up to 1 liter!). This is particularly important for the health of your digestive system, as putting food (or caffeine) in your body before rehydrating can lead to digestive issues and fatigue.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="kcp-timeline__text">
        <p class="p--text">One packet of Ketomanna is rich enough that it should satiate you enough to be able to move into your day without your stomach rumbling at you. It also contains 12g of MCTs, which when consumed as your first food of the day, your body will use for energy. This also begins to train your body to burn fats more efficiently, which will make your transition to ketosis easier next week.</p>

        <p class="p--text">Caffeine is a tremendously valuable tool to use to support your cleanse process. For starters, caffeine (coffee in particular) is a good appetite suppressant, which will make the cleanse easier to adhere to, particularly the mornings when you’re perhaps eating less than you’re accustomed to.</p>
        <p class="p--text">In weeks two and three when we’re moving into more active cleansing, caffeine has been shown to actually increase the rate of autophagy (cellular self-cleaning).</p>
        <p class="p--text">Be mindful of what you add to your coffee or tea, as using a creamer with significant sugar or protein will disrupt your cleanse. This means whole milk and heavy cream are out, as is any non-dairy milk not explicitly labeled as unsweetened. Go for organic skim milk, unsweetened almond milk or butter/ghee (see recipe in your guide)…or just drink it black, of course.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="kcp-timeline__text">
        <p class="p--text">Ketobasis continues the beneficial processes you started with your breakfast.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Ketobasis is comprised almost entirely of caprylic acid (aka C8), a specific fat from coconuts that your body converts to energy very quickly after consuming. (so quickly, in fact, that it cannot be stored as fat)</p>

        <p class="p--text">Because it converts to energy so quickly, Ketobasis will help keep your energy levels high and your brain sharp. It will also train your body to use fats for energy more efficiently, something that will make your transition to ketosis easier next week.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Ketobasis also has a slight appetite-suppressing effect, and paired with caffeine, the two should effectively keep your appetite in check until lunch time.</p>
        <p class="p--text">To prepare Ketobasis, mix one serving in ~8oz of water in a jar and shake well. Drinking this slowly over the course of an hour will help to make sure your stomach is cool with it, as MCTs can create some stomach weirdness for some people if consumed too quickly.</p>

      <div class="kcp-timeline__text">
        <p class="p--text">The bacteria that inhabit your GI tract (aka your “microbiome”) do so much more for you than digest your food. A healthy microbiome effectively acts as a first line of defense for your immune system, preventing harmful bacteria and viruses from entering the body. A healthy microbiome also “trains” your own immune cells to better detect and eliminate harmful bacteria that do make it into the body.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Of course, your GI bacteria do also digest your food, which is where they have particular importance for the cleanse. Building a robust, healthy microbiome will help to clear stagnant, undigested, and sometimes toxic material from your digestive tract. A healthy microbiome will also adapt more quickly to digesting a higher fat intake, which will be of particular importance next week.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Micro · Bios and Pre · Bios are an elegant and powerful system for building a healthy microbiome, reflecting the latest developments in microbiology research.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Micro · Bios is a spore-form PRObiotic, beneficial strains of bacteria grown in specific conditions such that they survive the acidity of the stomach and reach the small intestine where they stimulate the growth of existing beneficial bacteria already in your gut. (with non-spore-form probiotics, 99+% die in your stomach and never reach the small intestine)</p>
        <p class="p--text">Pre · Bios provides six unique types of PREbiotic fibers that provide food for the beneficial bacteria species in your gut, helping them to outcompete non-beneficial and parasitic species.</p>
        <p class="p--text">If you historically have a sensitive stomach, you could start with one serving of Pre · Bios and one capsule of Micro · Bios in the first day or two just to be sure your stomach agrees with them.</p>
