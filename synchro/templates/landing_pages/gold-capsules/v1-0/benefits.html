        <p class="p--text">When our bodies are inflamed, we feel achy and sluggish, and our brain feels like it’s lost in a fog.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Gold balances the body’s inflammation response by using liposomal delivery and black pepper extract to dramatically increase the bioavailability of turmeric’s beneficial compounds, amplifying their healing effects in the
          body. [1]</p>

        <p class="p--text">Remember when you could go for a run or workout without feeling sore? That doesn’t have to be a thing of the past.</p>
        <p class="p--text">Gold restores a healthy inflammation response in the joints, allowing you to live the life you want without having to worry about sore joints and muscles getting in the way.</p>

        <p class="p--text">Any good doctor will tell you: An inflamed body always leads to an inflamed, cloudy brain. [1]</p>
        <p class="p--text">Gold restores a healthy inflammation response in the brain, resulting in major improvements in brain function, mood and memory. Turmeric is also strongly neuroprotective and research has shown its promise in slowing the
          progression of neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s and depression. [2]</p>

        <h4 class="benefits-2__header">Promotes Lasting Healing + Anti-Aging</h4>
        <p class="p--text">Maybe the most remarkable function of Gold is its capacity to stimulate two of our body’s own, internal healing mechanisms: Antioxidant Enzymes and Stem Cell Proliferation. Keeping these two systems healthy is perhaps
          closest thing we have to a ‘fountain of youth’ - restoring youth and vitality to our cells and, most importantly, allowing the body to truly heal on its own. [4]</p>
